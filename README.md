# tetraloops-trajectories

These are the trajectories at 300.8 K for ccUUCGgg and ccGAGAgg reported in Bottaro et al. 2017 JPCL (see reference below).
We make available a sample  plumed.dat file used for the analysis, the resulting free energy surfaces (fes) as well as the HILLS files.

The full trajectories as well as trajectories at different temperatures are avilable upon request at sandro.bottaro@bio.ku.dk or at sandro dot bottaro (snail) gmail dot com.
